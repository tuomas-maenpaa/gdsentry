# GDSentry - No Contributions Please

**ðŸš« This project is not accepting contributions at this time.**

## Project Status

GDSentry is a hobby project created for personal learning and experimentation with Godot testing frameworks. It is **not actively maintained** and **does not accept contributions**.

## For Users

If you find GDSentry useful:

1. **Use it freely** - Licensed under MIT
2. **Fork it** - Create your own version if you want to maintain it
3. **Modify it** - The license allows you to adapt it for your needs

## For Developers

**Do not submit pull requests** - they will not be reviewed or merged.

**Do not create issues** - GitHub issues are disabled.

Instead, consider:

### Option 1: Fork and Maintain

```bash
# Fork the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gdsentry.git
cd gdsentry

# Make your improvements
# Create your own releases
# Maintain your version
```

### Option 2: Create New Project

- Use GDSentry as inspiration
- Build your own testing framework
- Make it actively maintained

### Option 3: Community Sharing

- Share your improvements on Godot forums
- Post to Godot Discord or Reddit
- Help other developers learn

## Why No Contributions?

This is a personal hobby project, not a community project. The maintainer:

- May not have time to review PRs
- Cannot commit to maintenance or support
- Prefers to keep the project simple and personal
