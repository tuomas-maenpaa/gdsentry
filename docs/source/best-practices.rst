Best Practices
==============

Guidelines and recommendations for effective GDSentry usage.

Testing Principles
------------------

- Write tests that validate behavior, not implementation
- Keep tests fast and reliable
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

Code Organization
-----------------

- Group related tests in test suites
- Use descriptive method names
- Separate test data from test logic
- Keep test files focused on specific functionality

Performance Considerations
--------------------------

- Run tests in headless mode for CI/CD
- Use appropriate test types for different scenarios
- Monitor test execution time
- Parallelize independent tests when possible
