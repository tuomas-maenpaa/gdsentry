GDSentry - Advanced Godot Testing Framework
=========================================

GDSentry represents a fundamental shift in how developers approach testing within the Godot ecosystem. Traditional testing frameworks focus narrowly on unit testing, but GDSentry recognizes that game development demands comprehensive validation across multiple dimensions: visual correctness, performance requirements, UI interactions, and system integration.

What Makes GDSentry Different?
============================

âœ… **Game-Focused Testing**: Visual tests, UI interactions, physics validation, performance monitoring
âœ… **Zero Configuration**: Works out-of-the-box with any Godot project
âœ… **Comprehensive Tooling**: Mocking, fixtures, CI/CD integration, detailed reporting
âœ… **Production Ready**: Used in shipped games, battle-tested across Godot 3.x and 4.x

Core Capabilities
=================

**Visual Testing**
  Validate UI layouts, animations, and visual states. Perfect for ensuring your game looks right across different screen sizes and configurations.

**Performance Testing**
  Monitor FPS, memory usage, and execution times. Catch performance regressions before they reach players.

**UI Interaction Testing**
  Simulate user input, test button interactions, and validate accessibility features.

**Physics Testing**
  Verify collision detection, force applications, and physics state consistency.

**Integration Testing**
  Test complete game flows and multi-system interactions.

**Mocking & Fixtures**
  Isolate code under test with sophisticated mocking capabilities and dependency management.
